#Agilent entrusts open-source software to University of Oregon#

In a move that will benefit the international scientific community for years to come, Agilent Technologies has announced that an updated version of their VnmrJ software will be made freely available to the international scientific community through the University of Oregon. The software is used to operate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instruments and scanners and for the analysis of NMR spectroscopic data.

NMR spectroscopy is a key research technique in chemistry, molecular biology, medicine, materials science, imaging, and many other research disciplines.  NMR makes use of the magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei to gain detailed information about the structure, dynamics, reaction state, and chemical environment of molecules.   NMR systems are in extensive use in hundreds of academic, government, and commercial labs around the world.  The UO maintains five such NMR systems in its CAMCOR shared instrument facility.

For more than 30 years VnmrJ and its antecedents have served as the proprietary commercial software for operators of Varian and Agilent NMR spectrometers.  The version to be released and maintained by UO is known as OpenVnmrJ.  It contains more than 3 million lines of code, and represents nearly 300 “person years” of software engineering time. 

“Agilent’s VnmrJ software is a vital tool in research in chemistry, biology and medicine."  said Professor Gareth Morris of University of Manchester, UK.  "Over the years the spectrometers and body scanners it supports have made major contributions in many branches of science, including the development of new medicines and new medical imaging methods.  Agilent’s gift of the full source code of this important resource to the magnetic resonance community helps safeguard the future of many tens of millions of dollars worth of NMR equipment in industrial and academic laboratories, and will be widely and warmly welcomed."

The UO has accepted ownership and custody of the software code, which will be maintained and supported by an international group of NMR experts for the benefit of the greater NMR community, said Michael Strain, a senior research associate and director of the UO’s NMR Spectroscopy Facility.

 “There are very few other instances of an open-source release of formerly proprietary scientific software products of this magnitude,” said Strain, who serves as the UO technical contact and liaison to users of the software. The release of this software will enable NMR labs around the world to continue to support their Varian/Agilent NMR systems, and will enable all sorts of future developments in the field that are yet to be imagined.”

Strain credited UO Associate Vice President for Innovation Chuck Williams with having the legal agility to put the agreement in place in a timely manner. Williams, who directs the UO’s Innovation Partnership Services unit, saw the agreement as an important opportunity to support the larger scientific community: 

“Mike and the other research scientists at UO conduct world class research and provide key industry research services that could have been threatened if Agilent and the developer community hadn’t stepped up to the plate.  We are delighted to be the host for that community and thank Agilent for its generosity and support.”

By December 1st, 2015 the OpenVnmrJ software will be made available on GitHub by UO under Apache 2.0 and/or GPLv3 open source licenses. While the UO owns the title to OpenVnmrJ, Agilent retains the rights to VnmrJ 4.2 and previous versions of the software.  An external advisory body, the VnmrJ Open Source Steering Group (VOSSG), comprised of leading scientists from the international NMR community as well as some of the original software developers, will help manage the release of the software code and oversee its future development by the NMR community.

There are over 7000 site licenses of the commercial version of VnmrJ around the world, with each site likely to have multiple operators.  As a result,  there are a very significant number of people using VnmrJ.
